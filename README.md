# Color Picker
The program is an implementation of a color picker tool based on HSV and RGB color representations. It was created using the SFML library.
The software uses a font created by me, Robert Pintera, and it was made using the BitFontMaker2 tool from Pentacom.jp. The font can be used for anything under the OFL license. The content of the license is located in the "Fonts" folder.
